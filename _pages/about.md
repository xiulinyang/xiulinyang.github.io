Hi! My name is Xiulin Yang and I'm currently a third-year PhD student in Computational Linguistics at <a href='https://www.georgetown.edu/' target ='_top'>Georgetown University</a>, advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3cozMf4AAAAJ' target ='_top'>Professor Nathan Schneider</a>. At Georgetown, I also work closely with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5jzLBBwAAAAJ&hl=en' target ='_top'>Professor Ethan Wilcox</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Grvf4zYAAAAJ&hl=en' target ='_top'>Professor Amir Zeldes</a>. I'm a member of <a href='http://nert.georgetown.edu/' target ='_top'>NERT</a> and <a href='https://github.com/picol-georgetown/wiki' target ='_top'>PICoL</a>.

Before that, I have been lucky to work with <a href = 'https://www.jyfindlay.com/' target ='_top'> Professor Jamie Findlay </a> and <a href = 'https://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/people/hanne-eckhoff' target ='_top'> Professor Hanne Eckhoff </a> at Oxford,<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yni3K9wAAAAJ&hl=en' target='_top'> Professor Alexander Koller </a> at Saarland and <a href = 'https://www.rug.nl/staff/johan.bos/cv?lang=en' target = '_top'> Professor Johan Bos</a> at Groningen.


I’m broadly interested in Computational Linguistics, Cognitive Science, NLP, and linguistic theories. I have worked and am working on the following areas:

- generalization of language models (To what extend can language models generalize from their training data?)

- inductive bias of language models and humans (What's the difference between human mind and language models? How can we make language models more human like by introducing such inductive bias?)

- learnability of natural languages (what makes some languages harder to learn to machines?)

- computational semantics (How to develop accurate and generalizable parsers? How can we incorporate meaning representation to downstream tasks?)

- neuro-symbolic NLP (How to incorporate linguistic information to NLP tasks?)

- targeted evaluation of language models (What do language models know about natural language we speak?)

When I'm not in front of the screen, you can find me bouldering/wall-climbing, reading (I'm a big fan of science fictions!), or swimming.
