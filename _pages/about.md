Hi! My name is Xiulin Yang and I'm currently a second-year PhD student doing Computational Linguistics at Georgetown University, advised by <a href = 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3cozMf4AAAAJ.' target ='_top'> Professor Nathan Schneider.

Before that, I have been lucky to work with <a href = 'https://www.jyfindlay.com/' target ='_top'> Dr. Jamie Findlay </a> and <a href = 'https://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/people/hanne-eckhoff' target ='_top'> Professor Hanne Eckhoff </a> at Oxford,<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yni3K9wAAAAJ&hl=en' target='_top'> Professor Alexander Koller </a> at Saarland and <a href = 'https://www.rug.nl/staff/johan.bos/cv?lang=en' target = '_top'> Professor Johan Bos</a> at Groningen.

My primary interest lies in Computational Linguistics, NLP, Sytnax, and its interface with Semantics. I'm excited to explore how to develop linguistically-motivated, transparent, and (compositionally) generalizable NLP tools and how to objectively evaluate the performance and behavior of existing language models on top of current benchmark datasets. I believe linguistics can provide inspirations to build more explainable and robust neural language models in the way that it helps people be aware of the limitation and strengths of both symbolic and neural approaches in linguistics research and AI applications.

More specifically, I'm interested in compositional generalization, neural-symbolic approaches in NLP and cognitive plausibility of neural networks. I'm also excited to explore new areas!

When I'm not in front of the screen, you can find me bouldering/wall-climbing, reading (I'm a big fan of science fictions!), or swimming.
